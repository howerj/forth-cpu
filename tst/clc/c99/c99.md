### ANSI C Yacc grammar

In 1985, Jeff Lee published his Yacc grammar (which is accompanied by
a matching Lex specification) for the April 30, 1985 draft version
of the ANSI C standard. Tom Stockfisch reposted it to net.sources
in 1987; that original, as mentioned in the answer to question
17.25 of the comp.lang.c FAQ, can be ftp'ed from ftp.uu.net, file
usenet/net.sources/ansi.c.grammar.Z.

Jutta Degener, 1995
